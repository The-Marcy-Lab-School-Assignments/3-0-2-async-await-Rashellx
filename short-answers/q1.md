# Question
Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer
`async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch` because the control flow is clearer since it looks like synchronous code. Basically the code is less messy becuase there is no chaining and nesting in it, unlike  `.then` and `.catch`.
