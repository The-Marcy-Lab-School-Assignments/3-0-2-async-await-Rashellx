# Question

Will the code work? Why or why not?

```js
const getUsers = async () => {
  const url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users';
  const users = await fetch(url).then(r => r.json()).catch((err) => []);
  console.log(users)
  return users;
}
getUsers()
```

Again, running the code gives you the answer, so try to figure it out on your own first!

# Answer
Yes, the code will work! The code includes a `async` and `await` keyword, which means it is returning a promise and waiting for the fetch function to resolve. The function works because the code is handling getting the data from a website, making sure it waits for the data, checks if everything is fine, and finally using (returning) that data.
